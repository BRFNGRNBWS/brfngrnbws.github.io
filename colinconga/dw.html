		<h>Here lies my collection of complete Doctor Who episodes, in the best quality that I could find them. My main focus is the classic series, but I might have some new ones on here, too.<br><br><a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B9ROvvqxmoobdjNkcENuSm1ROWs?usp=sharing">Here is the link</a> (Google Drive). You should be able to watch and/or download them all from Drive.<br><br> Eventually I plan to have all of the classic series, and maybe the new ones, too. I'll work on it as often as I can, but this is hard stuff, man.<br><br>I pretty much upload these as I watch them.<br><br>If a classic episode you want isn't on here, <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GM_5u2J6vQtamswOgrGRovmIiRkFU12Acdcbgjy1BE4/edit?pref=2&pli=1#gid=461063955">this</a> is an amazing resource.<br>If a new episode you want isn't on here, just watch some classic while you wait for Netflix. Probably a better idea, since the new ones on here are terrible quality compared to what most people are used to.</h>

		<p>Also, just in case you were wondering, my favorite classic Doctor (so far) is 3, and my favorite new Doctor is 10.</p>
