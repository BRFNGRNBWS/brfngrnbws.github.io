		<h2>The <i>correct</i> way to pronounce GIF is with a soft G, like in 'Jif'.</h2>
		<div id="middle">
			<h1>First, the purpose of this website.</h1>
			<p>The intended purpose of this website is not to convince you which way to pronounce gif (although that would be a nice side effect), because, frankly, I couldn't care less about how you pronounce it. What I care about is that you acknowledge that saying GIF with a hard 'g' is the incorrect way to say it. Again, let me repeat that: <b>I don't care how you pronounce it, and just because you pronounce it incorrectly doesn't mean that you have to pronounce it correctly. All I'm asking is that you acknowledge that you're wrong.</b></p>

			<h1>Now that that's out of the way, a rebuttal.</h1>
