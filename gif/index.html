		<h2>The <i>correct</i> way to pronounce GIF is with a soft G, like in 'Jif'.</h2>
		<div id="middle">
			<h1>First, the purpose of this website.</h1>
			
			<p>The intended purpose of this website is not to convince you which way to pronounce gif (although that would be a nice side effect), because, frankly, I couldn't care less about how you pronounce it. What I care about is that you acknowledge that saying GIF with a hard 'g' is the incorrect way to say it. Again, let me repeat that: I'm not telling you how you should pronounce it, I'm telling you the correct way to pronounce it. <b>All I'm really asking is that you acknowledge that you're wrong.</b></p>
			
			<br>
			
			<h1>Now that that's out of the way, a rebuttal.</h1>
			
			<br>
			
			<p><a href="http://howtoreallypronouncegif.com/" target="_blank">This</a> is a popular resource for hard g-ers to reference, as it is a collection of most of their arguments, presented in a fairly consice, well-written format. So, before I get to my argument, I'd like to rebut what some the points that Aaron Bazinet, the creator of the aforementioned website, has put forth.</p>
			
			<h3>"Itâ€™s the most natural, logical way to pronounce it."</h3>
			
			<p>This is the initial explaination as to why the correct way to pronounce it is with a hard g, but it's got 1 glaring issue:
			<br><br>
			<b>It is <i>completely</i> irrelevant.</b>
			<br><br>
			The correct way to pronounce something has nothing to do with the "natural" way to pronounce it.
			<br><br>
			This can be seen in a plethora of words <i>in the English language.</i> Examples include any words with silent letters, words where a c makes an s sound, and words where g makes a j sound, just to name a few.</p>
			
			<br>
			
			<h3>"Every word that starts with G, then a vowel, then an F, is pronounced with a hard G."</h3>
			
			<p>Once again, this argument is <b>entirely irrelevant.</b>
			<br><br>
			A list of English words that meet these criteria is presently listed, but it doesnt matter, because <b>GIF is not an English word,</b> and it doesn't have the same or even similar origins to most English words.
			<br><br>
			GIF is an acronym that was made up by a guy who invented a graphics format. Coming up with a combination of letters and then pronouncing it as a word doesn't mean that you can apply English pronunciation standards to it, or use English word origins to try and prove its pronunciation, either.</p>
			
			<br>
			
			<h3>"What about Gin, Gem, Gym, Geo, and Gel?"</h3>
			
			<p>Gin and Gem are explained by tracing their origins to words beginning with j, but the remaining three are brushed off as being "abbreviations of larger words", inheriting their pronunciations. Why should this matter? It's still an instance of a g making a j sound, and who cares about the length? That doesn't affect pronunciation at all.
			<br><br>
			As for them, Gymnasium and Geography both have origins in Greek words that begin with 'g', while Gelatin has roots in both the English 'jelly' and the Latin 'gelar'.
			<br><br>
			On top of this, the point is <b>once again irrelevant</b>, because, as I've explained already, GIF isn't an English word with English word origins, and as such, can't be analysed in reference to them.
			</p>
			
			<br>
			
			<h1>Finally, what I have to say.</h1>
			
			<br>
			
			<p>Ok, so here's my argument. My big reveal, the words that will stop hard g-ers dead in their tracks:
			<br><br>
			<b><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF#Pronunciation_of_GIF" target="_blank">The creator of the format says that it's pronounced with a soft g.</a></i></b>
			<br><br>
			I know what you're probably thinking: <i>But you can't base an entire argument on one point, one thing that one person said! Besides, Mr. Bazinet clearly says that there are no good arguments for pronouncing it with a soft g, for this exact reason!</i>
			<br><br>
			And you know what? You're wrong.
