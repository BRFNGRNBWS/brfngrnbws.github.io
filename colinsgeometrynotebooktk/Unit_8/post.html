		<ul>
			<li><b>AA Similarity Postulate: </b>If two angles of one triangle are congruent to two angles of another triangle, then the triangles are similar.</li>
			<li><b>SSS Similarity Theorem: </b>If the three sides of one triangle are proportional to the three sides of another triangle, then the triangles are similar.</li>
			<li><b>SAS Similarity Theorem: </b>If two sides of one triangle are proportional to two sides of another triangle and their uncluded angles are congruent, then the triangles are similar.</li>
			<li><b>Proportional Altitude Theorem: </b>If two triangles are similar, then their corresponding altitudes have the same ratio as their corresponding sides.</li>
			<li><b>Proportional Medians Theorem: </b>If two triangles are similar, then their corresponding medians have the same ratio as their corresponding sides.</li>
			<li><b>Proportional Angle Bisector Theorem: </b>If two triangles are similar, then their corresponding angle bisectors have the same ratio as the corresponding sides.</li>
			<li><b>Proportional Segments Theorem: </b>An angle bisector of triangle divides the opposite side into two segments that have the same ratio as the other two sides.</li>
			<li><b>Cross-Multiplication Property of Proportions: </b>For real numbers a, b, c, and d such that a, b, c, and d&#8800;0, if a/b = c/d, then ad = bc.</li>
			<li><b>Reciprocal Property of Proportions: </b>For real numbers a, b, c, and d such that a, b, c, and d&#8800;0, if a/b = c/d, then b/a = d/c.</li>
			<li><b>Exchange Property of Proportions: </b>For real numbers a, b, c, and d such that a, b, c, and d&#8800;0, if a/b = c/d, then a/c = b/d.</li>
			<li><b>"Add-One" Property of Proportions: </b>For real numbers a, b, c, and d such that b and d&#8800;0, if a/b = c/d, then (a+b)/b = (c+d)/d.</li>
			<li><b>Polygon Similarity Postulate: </b>Two polygons are similar if and only if there is a way of setting up a correspondence between their sides and angles such that the following conditions are met: 
				<ol>
					<li>Each pair of corresponding angles is congruent</li>
					<li>Each pair of corresponding sides is proportional</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
