			<li><b>Isosceles Triangle Theorem: </b>If two sides of a triangle are congruent, then the angles opposite those sides are congruent.</li>
			<li><b>Converse of the Isosceles Triangle Theorem: </b>If two angles of a triangle are congruent, then the sides opposite those angles are congruent.</li>
			<li><b>4.4.3: </b>The measure of each angle of an equalateral triangle is 60&deg;</li>
			<li><b>4.4.4: </b>The bisector of the vertex angle of an isosceles triangle is the perpendicular bisector fo the base.</li>
			<li><b>Exterior Angle Theorem: </b>The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the angles of the remote interior angles.</li>
			<li><b>Overlapping Angles Theorem: </b>Given &ang;AOD with points B and C in its interior, the following statements are true:
				<ul>
					<li>If m&ang;AOB = m&ang;COD, then m&ang;AOC = m&ang;BOD</li>
					<li>If m&ang;AOC = m&ang;BOD, then m&ang;AOB = m&ang;COD</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><b>Jurgensen Isosceles Triangle Theorem: </b>If two sides of a triangle are congruent, then the angles opposite those sides are congruent.
				<ul>
					<li><b>Corollary 1: </b>An equalateral triangle is also equiangular.</li>
					<li><b>Corollary 2: </b>An equilateral triangle had three 60&deg; angles.</li>
					<li><b>Corollary 3: </b>The bisector of the vertex angle of an isosceles triangle is perpendicular to the base at its midpoint.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><b>4-2: </b>If two angles of a triangle are congruent, then the sides opposite those angles are congruent
				<ul>
					<li><b>Corollary: </b>An equalateral triangle is also equalateral.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><b>Angle Addition Theorem: </b>If point B lies in the interior of &ang;AOC, then m&ang;AOC + m&ang;BOC = m&ang;AOC. If &ang;AOC is a straight angle and B is any point not on line AC, then m&ang;AOB + m&ang;BOC = 180.</li>
			<li><b>Angle Addition Postulate: </b>If B is between A and C, then AB + BC = AC.</li>
